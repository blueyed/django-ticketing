0.3.0
* Added BigAutoField, which allows for extra large tickets on MySQL backends

0.4.0
* Add TicketField, which allows one to use a ticket as a field in other classes.

0.5.0
* Fixed a race condition in TicketManager.create() I wanted to emulate the
default behavior and return a Ticket instance, but I was doing so by executing
a second get query to get the object with that new ticket id. But that object
isn't guaranteed to exist!
